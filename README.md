# Java-Output-Formatting
* Input Format

* Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
* Each String will have a maximum of 10  alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.

* Output Format

* In each line of output there should be two columns:
* The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
* The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
